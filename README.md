# SMS-Spam-Detection-using-TensorFlow

In today's digital age, mobile phones are omnipresent, serving as our primary communication tool. 
However, the convenience of receiving SMS and emails comes with a downside: spam. 
The majority of messages flooding our inboxes are unsolicited, posing threats such as scams and phishing attempts.

We're developing deep learning models using TensorFlow for SMS spam detection. Leveraging the SMS Spam Detection Dataset, we aim to create robust models to accurately distinguish between spam and legitimate messages. 
By analyzing various model performances, we seek to enhance users' experience by reducing spam clutter and safeguarding personal information from exploitation.
